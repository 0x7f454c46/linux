Subject: [PATCH 00/20] kernel: Introduce Time Namespace

Discussions around time namespace are there for a long time. The first
attempt to implement it was in 2006 by Jeff Dike. From that time, the
topic appears on and off in various discussions.

There are two main use cases for time namespaces:
1. change date and time inside a container;
2. adjust clocks for a container restored from a checkpoint.

“It seems like this might be one of the last major obstacles keeping
migration from being used in production systems, given that not all
containers and connections can be migrated as long as a time dependency
is capable of messing it up.” (by github.com/dav-ell)

The kernel provides access to several clocks: CLOCK_REALTIME,
CLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_BOOTTIME. Last two clocks are monotonous, but the
start points for them are not defined and are different for each
system. When a container is migrated from one node to another, all
clocks have to be restored into consistent states; in other words, they
have to continue running from the same points where they have been
dumped.

The main idea of this patch set is adding per-namespace offsets for
system clocks. When a process in a non-root time namespace requests
time of a clock, a namespace offset is added to the current value of
this clock and the sum is returned.

All offsets are placed on a separate page, this allows us to map it as
part of VVAR into user processes and use offsets from VDSO calls.

Now offsets are implemented for CLOCK_MONOTONIC and CLOCK_BOOTTIME
clocks.

v2: There are two major changes from the previous version:

* Two versions of the VDSO library to avoid a performance penalty for
  host tasks outside time namespace (as suggested by Andy and Thomas).

  As it has been discussed on timens RFC, adding a new conditional branch
  `if (inside_time_ns)` on VDSO for all processes is undesirable.
  It will add a penalty for everybody as branch predictor may mispredict
  the jump. Also there are instruction cache lines wasted on cmp/jmp.

  Those effects of introducing time namespace are very much unwanted
  having in mind how much work have been spent on micro-optimisation
  VDSO code.

  Addressing those problems, there are two versions of VDSO's .so:
  for host tasks (without any penalty) and for processes inside of time
  namespace with clk_to_ns() that subtracts offsets from host's time.


* Allow to set clock offsets for a namespace only before any processes
  appear in it.

  Now a time namespace looks similar to a pid namespace in a way how it is
  created: unshare(CLONE_NEWTIME) system call creates a new time namespace,
  but doesn't set it to the current process. Then all children of
  the process will be born in the new time namespace, or a process can
  use the setns() system call to join a namespace.

  This scheme allows to create a new time namespaces, set clock offsets
  and then populate the namespace with processes.

Our performance measurements show that the price of VDSO's clock_gettime()
in a child time namespace is about 8% with a hot CPU cache and about 90%
with a cold CPU cache. There is no performance regression for host
processes outside time namespace on those tests.

We wrote two small benchmarks. The first one gettime_perf.c calls
clock_gettime() in a loop for 3 seconds. It shows us performance with
a hot CPU cache (more clock_gettime() cycles - the better):

        | before     | CONFIG_TIME_NS=n | host        | inside timens
--------|------------|------------------|-------------|-------------
cycles  | 139887013  | 139453003        | 139899785   | 128792458
diff (%)| 100        | 99.7             | 100         | 92

The second one gettime_perf_cold.c calls rdtsc, clock_gettime(), rdtsc
and shows a difference of second and first rdtsc. We call this binary in
a loop 1000 times, get 1000 values and calculate MODE for them.
It should show us performance with a cold CPU cache
(lesser tsc per cycle - the better):

        | before     | CONFIG_TIME_NS=n | host        | inside timens
--------|------------|------------------|-------------|-------------
tsc     | 6748       | 6718             | 6862        | 12682
diff (%)| 100        | 99.6             | 101.7       | 188

The numbers gathered on Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6300U CPU @ 2.40GHz.
